# Reflections:

## What the app does well:
The dash offers to the user a clear visualization that helps answer the research question. The plots are properly labeled and there is an appropriate use of color to highlight the different line plots which enable the user to visualize the selected data and differentiate one job role from the other.
The plots in the app follow the principle of proportional ink. The plot is minimalistic but still has the required interactive tools available such as drop-down menus and radio buttons. The plot gives the user the ability to hide uninteresting job roles using mouse clicks on the legend menu so the user can further visualize the job roles he or she is interested in visualzing in detail.  

## Limitations: 
The plots have data till the year 2000 which might make it seem outdated for a user who wants to use it in 2019.
This is because the source dataset itself is until the year 2000.
The data set has several more job roles, but we are focusing only on the top 10 of them. We would have liked to broaden the search and encompassed more job roles. The dataset has data that includes gender and that could have been used to widen the research question into including the distribution of job roles according to gender.
The plot itself could have been a bit more refined by adding a hamburger menu like that in the sketch.
The selection of the Job roles by the user is now implicit by delecting the job roles the user is not interested in visualizing.
This deselection is done on the legend menu and not on the plot itself. This can be made more intuitively.
The app has some limitations on its interactivity which were imposed due to lack of available built-in functions in R-plotly.
Some improvements like expanding the research question beyond the "top 10 jobs" could not be implemented due to lack of time availablity. 

## Future improvements and enhancements:

- The App can be expanded to include more job roles and slider for year selection can be added to it.  
- A hamburger menu can be used hide the menu so the plot can be expanded to occupy the available screen space.  
- The selection of the desired data can be made more intuitively by selecting the bar plots rather than the legend menu.  
- The overall aesthetics of the app can be improved upon by better choice of colour theme.
